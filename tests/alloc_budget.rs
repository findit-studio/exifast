//! Golden-v2 C4 — allocation-count guard harness.
//!
//! A counting `#[global_allocator]` (a thin wrapper over [`std::alloc::System`]
//! that bumps an [`AtomicUsize`] on every `alloc`) lets us MEASURE the heap
//! allocation count of a full `media_metadata` / `parse_bytes` extraction over
//! a handful of representative fixtures. The Phase-A.3 perf items are pure
//! speedups — byte-identical output, fewer allocations — so this harness is the
//! deliverable proof: it records the per-fixture alloc count and (after the
//! perf work lands) PINS an upper bound so a future regression that
//! reintroduces an O(n²) scan / a redundant clone / a double decode trips the
//! gate.
//!
//! ## How the counter is isolated
//!
//! The global allocator counts EVERY allocation in this test binary, including
//! `std::fs::read`, the test harness, and `format!`/panic machinery. To attribute
//! allocations to the parse alone we (1) read the fixture bytes FIRST, OUTSIDE the
//! measured region, (2) warm the detection/parse once (so any lazily-initialized
//! statics are already allocated), (3) snapshot the counter, run the entry point,
//! snapshot again, and report the delta. The measured closure's owned result is
//! moved OUT of the measured region (returned) so its eventual drop — a
//! deallocation, not an allocation — is irrelevant to the alloc count anyway.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test --test alloc_budget -- --nocapture` to see the printed
//! counts.

    // `LensType`, no IPTC date), but each attempt allocates its per-def
    // `$val[]`/`$prt[]` scratch pair, so `-j` rises +6 and `-n` +6 (the
    // engine-overhead cost the existing #133-PR-3 comment already flagged a
    // future perf PR could shave by reusing the scratch Vecs). The prior `(870,
    // 990)` ceiling was also already exceeded on the base (the measured drifted
    // to (884, 1002) before #381 without a re-baseline); the new ceilings cover
    // BOTH the drift and the #381 +6. `media_metadata` is UNCHANGED by the new
    // Composites (163, never runs the post-pass).

    // post-pass (the full-video flip), building `Composite:AvgBitrate`/`ImageSize`/
    // `Megapixels`/`Rotation` + re-emitting the opposite view — `-j` 135 → 195,
    // `-n` 137 → 213. The intended cost of the newly-built video composites (the

    // `DateTimeCreated` set that also re-baselined `MakerNotes_Apple` above),
