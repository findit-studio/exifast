#![cfg(feature = "quicktime")]
//! Faithful port of `Image::ExifTool::Protobuf::ProcessProtobuf`
//! (Protobuf.pm:128-300) driven by the `%Image::ExifTool::DJI::Protobuf`
//! tag table (DJI.pm:235-859) plus its nested message tables
//! `DJI::FrameInfo` / `DJI::GPSInfo` / `DJI::DroneInfo` / `DJI::GimbalInfo`
//! (DJI.pm:867-921). Decodes the DJI `djmd` (real metadata) protobuf-format
//! timed-metadata samples reached through the `djmd` MetaFormat dispatch in
//! [`crate::formats::quicktime_stream`]. (QuickTimeStream.pl:349-358 routes
//! both `djmd` AND `dbgi` SubDirectories into `Image::ExifTool::DJI::Protobuf`,
//! but the `dbgi` table is `Unknown => 2`, QuickTimeStream.pl:355 — under the
//! default `Unknown = 0` `ProcessSamples` does not process a `dbgi` sample at
//! all, so exifast's default-options port treats `dbgi` as a complete no-op and
//! this module decodes only `djmd`.)
//!
//! ## Wire format (Protobuf.pm:18-117, ref protobuf.dev/.../encoding)
//!
//! A protobuf message is a flat sequence of records, each:
//! `[tag varint][payload]`, where `tag = (field_number << 3) | wire_type`.
//! Four wire types are produced by DJI bodies:
//!  - **0 = VARINT** — base-128 little-endian, ≤10 bytes for a u64
//!    ([`read_varint`]).
//!  - **1 = I64** — 8 fixed bytes (a `double` for DJI's I64 fields).
//!  - **2 = LEN** — `[len varint][len bytes]` — a string, a packed
//!    `rational` (two inner varints num/den), OR a nested message.
//!  - **5 = I32** — 4 fixed bytes (a `float` for DJI's I32 fields).
//!
//! Wire types 3/4 (deprecated start/end group) carry an empty payload
//! (Protobuf.pm:99-103); the walker accepts and skips them.
//!
//! ## Tag ID's are hierarchical paths
//!
//! DJI's tag table keys (e.g. `dvtm_ac203_3-4-2-2`) are the `.proto` file
//! name (minus `.proto`) joined to the chain of protobuf field numbers from
//! the top-level message down to the leaf (DJI.pm:244 NOTES). The walker
//! recurses into every nested (wire-type-2) message, accumulating the field
//! path, and matches each leaf `(protocol, path)` against the per-protocol
//! dispatch table ([`PROTOCOLS`]).
//!
//! ## The `int64s` "hack" (Protobuf.pm:181-185)
//!
//! DJI drones store 64-bit SIGNED integers improperly: a small negative
//! value is written as a varint whose top 32 bits are all 1's. Bundled
//! recovers the signed value when `val >= 0xffffffff00000000` by `val -
//! 0xffffffff00000000 - 0x100000000` (two subtractions to avoid 64-bit
//! overflow). [`decode_int64s`] mirrors this. `AbsoluteAltitude` and the
//! Drone/Gimbal orientation angles are all `int64s` fields.
//!
//! ## GPS coordinate conversion (DJI.pm:900-920)
//!
//! `GPSInfo` carries `CoordinateUnits` (field 1), `GPSLatitude` (field 2),
//! and `GPSLongitude` (field 3) as IEEE-754 doubles. When `CoordinateUnits`
//! is 0 / unset (the default), the lat/lon are in RADIANS and bundled converts
//! to degrees via `$val * 180 / 3.141592653589793`; when nonzero, they are
//! already degrees (DJI.pm:929/935, Perl-truthy). ExifTool reads
//! `$$self{CoordUnits}` PER-LEAF in each coordinate's RawConv at the moment it
//! is handled, so the conversion is done HERE the instant each
//! `GPSLatitude`/`GPSLongitude` is walked ([`coord_to_degrees`]) — a coordinate
//! preceding its `CoordinateUnits` sibling converts under the prior state. The
//! Mavic 4 Pro / Mini 5 Pro arms set `$$self{CoordUnits} = 1` via a
//! SubDirectory `Condition` evaluated when the GPSInfo message is reached
//! (DJI.pm:857 + :872), i.e. before its child coordinates. `CoordUnits` is
//! `$self`-scoped state that PERSISTS across samples within a track.
//!
//! ## What is decoded vs walked-only
//!
//! The typed surface [`crate::metadata::DjiProtobufMeta`] keeps the
//! camera-indexing fields (identity, GPS, altitude, capture settings, frame
//! info, orientation, timestamp). AccelerometerX/Y/Z (DJI.pm:286-288 etc.) and
//! per-protocol "model code" `# (NC)` fields are walked but discarded — matching
//! the bundled default-options gate where `Unknown` is unset. The `dbgi` debug
//! track (DJI.pm:355 `Unknown => 2`) is not processed at all under the default
//! options (a complete no-op — see the `dbgi` MetaFormat arm in
//! [`crate::formats::quicktime_stream`]).
